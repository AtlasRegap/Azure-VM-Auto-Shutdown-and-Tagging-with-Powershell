# Azure VM Auto-Shutdown and Tagging with PowerShell

## Overview
This project demonstrates automating Azure Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning using PowerShell, applying custom resource tags, and configuring auto-shutdown to optimize cloud costs.

## Steps Completed
- Connected to Azure using PowerShell.
- Created a Resource Group and deployed a VM with PowerShell.
- Applied tags to the VM for resource organization.
- Configured auto-shutdown to reduce unnecessary cloud spend (manual step via Azure Portal).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Azure PowerShell scripting
- Virtual machine provisioning automation
- Cloud cost management practices
- Resource tagging and organization

## How to Reproduce
1. Install Azure PowerShell Module.
2. Connect to Azure with `Connect-AzAccount`.
3. Run PowerShell scripts to create the VM and apply tags.
4. Configure auto-shutdown in the Azure Portal.

## Future Improvements
- Automate auto-shutdown scheduling with Azure Automation Runbooks.
- Extend script to deploy and manage multiple VMs.
